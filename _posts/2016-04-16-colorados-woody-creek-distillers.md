  Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco
  World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze
  assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally
  announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently
  owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown
  Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch
  Colorado Straight Rye.
